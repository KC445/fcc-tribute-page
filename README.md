# fcc-tribute-page

This is the second project for the freeCodeCamp program.  The project was to make a tribute page for real or fictional individual.  I decided to make a tribute page to my favorite video game growing up, Pokémon Red and Blue.

After completing this project, I realized it was a little more intense than necessary.  151 different items is a lot...especially when you keep having new format ideas after getting all of the HTML added.  That said I am proud of how it turned out.  I didn't really run into any issues making this site.  The main one was the flex not working on the list.  Turned out I was missing a "<" on a couple of my </li> tags.  Once I fixed those it all went smoothly.

I made the site before fully looking at the requirements for the freeCodeCamp project, so I had to add several unnecessary ids.  This may be the last project I do from freeCodeCamp, as I believe I the projects for The Odin Project, The Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp, and The Web Developer Bootcamp 2022 provide better learning opportunities.
